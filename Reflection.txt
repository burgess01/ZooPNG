One of the biggest challenges I had thus far with the lab was the understanding the syntax and semantics
of the code. We ran into many errors as a result. Although, each error was a learning experience and we often had to use external
references such as stack overflow for answers. Another challenge we had as a group was communication. We quickly recognized that we were not communicating
appropriate times to meet with to work on the code and of the program itself. We ressolved this and learned 
that it is vital that everyone in the group is on the same page.
